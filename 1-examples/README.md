Examples taken from real-life scores (png images).

It would be good to write code snippets reproducing them and add them to `tests/real-life cases`.

- [`bad-ties`](bad-ties) - examples of ugly ties, grouped in several categories.
- [`consider-these`](consider-these) - cases to keep in mind.  I don't yet know how they should look like.
- [`cross-voice`](cross-voice) - here the problem is not in the formatting, but with the voicing structure.
- [`hand-engraved`](hand-engraved) - examples from hand-engraved scores.
