Well, it mixes a "TieVoice" into the hierarchy between Staff and Voice.
If you say something like
\new Staff << \new Voice ...
              \new Voice ...
           >>
then both Voices will end up in the same TieVoice by default.  So there
might be cases where you need an explicit \new TieVoice to get ties not
merged between voices.

I'm more worried about the things that the fishing fixes where you don't
want it...

Another approach (actually, pretty much the same but with a different
naming scheme) would be

In spite of me saying "pretty much the same", it would appear that this
produces different output regarding the cross-staff angle, so one might
need to revise some more things.  Juggling around with Beam_engraver and
its ilk would suggest that LilyPond is not particularly well-prepared to
messing with the hierarchy too much: it would likely require some
experimentation to figure out just what group of engravers have to be
moved as one block.
